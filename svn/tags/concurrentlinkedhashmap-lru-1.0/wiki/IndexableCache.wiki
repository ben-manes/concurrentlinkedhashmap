#summary A tutorial for implementing a simple indexing decorator.
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

A [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.html Map] provides the ability to work with key->value pairs and treats each entry independently. A common use-case is that the same value could be retrieved by multiple keys. In most usages the map is unbounded and used for a short duration, so the value can be safely referenced in multiple key->value pairs.

In caches the map is bounded and multiple entries for the same value would impact the size and statistical information. An alternative approach is to store a primaryKey->value mapping in the cache and store the key->primaryKey mapping separately. When the value is added, removed, or evicted the key mapping must be updated accordingly.

== Example ==

An application may retrieve a user's profile by different lookup approaches. The primary usage may be by a unique identifier, while alternative flows may be by the user's email address or login name. In complex applications there may be many alternative lookup approaches based on multiple properties.

|| *Key* || *Property* || *Type* ||
|| id || user.getId() || Primary ||
|| email || user.getEmail() || Secondary ||
|| loginName || user.getLoginName() || Secondary ||

An interesting aspect of the keys is that they are all subsets of the properties on the value (its domain model). In most cases there is a relationship between the key and value rather than an ad hoc grouping. This can be leveraged to allow automatic extraction of the keys from the value.

== Usage ==

The following shows how indexing can be leveraged by a caching facade. The value contains metadata describing the cache information to allow automatic key extraction and association to a cache region. A benefit is that separate key classes are not required, but rather the domain object is treated like a template for retrieving the full value. This can be thought of as a "named lookup" style similar to Hibernate's "named query" approach.

{{{
public class UserProfileService {
    @Autowired
    private Cache cache;

    public User getUserById(long id) {
      User user = new User();
      user.setId(id);
      return cache.get(user, "byId");
    }

    public User getUserByEmail(String email) {
      User user = new User();
      user.setEmail(email);
      return cache.get(user, "byEmail");
    }

    public User getUserByLoginName(String loginName) {
      User user = new User();
      user.setLoginName(loginName);
      return cache.get(user, "byLoginName");
    }

    // etc
}
}}}

= Implementation =

The following shows an implementation of an indexable caching decorator. It uses a data map to store the association from the primaryKey to the value. A secondary map stores a key to the index. An entry is retrieved by using the lookup table to determine the primary key for retrieval from the data map.

== Concurrency ==

The !IndexMap must perform multiple operations when a insertion, update, or removal occurs to keep both mappings in sync. Rather than using a single lock, _lock striping_ can be used as each entry must have a unique set of keys. This allows a high level of concurrency while maintaining correctness by blocking concurrent operations for the same entry.

A traditional _static_ model is adopted by using an array of locks. This approach is performant, but requires a good sizing as independent entry operations may contend due to sharing a lock instance. An alternative _dynamic_ model leverages the garbage collector to acheive per entry locks, but will likely not offer a significant performance improvement in practice.

/**
 * A <tt>StripedLock</tt> provides mutual exclusion on an individual lock segment and high concurrency by allowing
 * multiple segments to be operated on independently. A selection algorithm assigns a resource to a {@link Lock}
 * instance so that shared access can be controlled and should provide a good spreading strategy to evenly distribute
 * the lock contention across all segments.
 * <p>
 * The characteristics and usage pattern should follow the same guidelines when working with the {@link Lock} instances
 * directly. The lock segment can be used indirectly through operations similar to those found in {@link Lock}. In most
 * cases the following idiom should be used:
 *
 * <pre><tt>
 *     Object o = ...;
 *     StripedLock lock = ...;
 *     lock.lock(o);
 *     try {
 *         // access the resource protected by this lock
 *     } finally {
 *         lock.unlock(o);
 *     }
 * </tt></pre>
 * <p>
 * Except where noted by an implementation, passing a <tt>null</tt> value for any parameter will result in a
 * {@link NullPointerException} or {@link IllegalStateException} being thrown.
