<!--
	Configures and controls the behaviour of the cache benchmarking framework.

	sampleSize
    this is the number of putsgets to be performed, an average is used in metrics.
	gcBetweenTestsEnabled
    if true, the framework pauses between each test and requests System.gc()
    use this if you find yourself running out of mem!
	sleepBetweenTests
    ms to sleep between tests.  useful to allow the JVM some time to do a gc
	emptyCacheBetweenTests
    again, use if you're running out of mem.
	numThreads
    the number of executor threads to use to perform the required number of operations.
